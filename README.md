# e-commerce-backend

## Description

This e-commerce backend was created to reach learning and evaluation objectives as part of a coding bootcamp from the University of Toronto. Its goal is to help an entrepreneur manage his e-commerce website backend.

## Installation

To install this application please clone this repository and make sure that you install all dependencies by running 'npm install'. Then open your mysql shell and source the schema.sql file. After this, run 'npm run seed' from the Develop folder to seed data to the database. Once these operations are performed, the command to launch the application from the Develop folder in the terminal is 'npm run start'. This will launch the local server and allow you to perform restful crud operations on the database from Insomnia. 

## Usage

Once Insomnia is launched, please create new http requests following the API routes to perform the operations you want on the database.
